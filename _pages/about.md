Hi, I'm Ammar! I recieved my BSc in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Nile University in Egypt in 2019 and I am currently working towards my MASc in Physics, Engineering Physics, and Astronomy at Queen's University in Kingston, Canada. I am a member of the [Shastri Lab](https://www.queensu.ca/physics/shastrilab/), where my research thesis is focused on realizing Photonic Neural Networks on a Silicon Photonics platform. Feel free to reach out!

Our lab studies how Photonics can be used for information processing, computing, and neural networks. During my journey in the lab I took graduate courses in Deep Learning, Unconventional Computing, Nanofabrication, and Active Silicon Photonics. As part of my studies, I got the opportunity to enter a clean room and fabricate my own devices using Electron Beam Lithography. I have also explored extensively the mathematics behind deep learning, which is essential to my research in implementing neural networks on Silicon Photonics. I have had the opportunity to experimentally measure Silicon Photonic Chips in the lab. 

Beyond the lab and the classroom, I have participated in Outreach to communicate the importance of photonics to the community. I was selected to be the Outreach and Community coordinator at Queen's University's Optica Student Chapter. I will be representing Optica and our lab at Kingston's Science Rendezvouz in May 2025, which is an event focused to communicating the sciences to the public.

 I taught, as a TA, the following courses at Queen's University: APSC 111 (Classical Mechanics), APSC 112 (Electricity and Magnetism), APSC 102 (Experimentation and Design), and PHYS 116 (Algebra-Based Physics). I have as well tutored more advanced courses such as 

 I do enjoy teaching, and therefore gathered a lot of independent tutoring experience. I have tutored a wide range of courses: Classical Mechanics, First Year Calculus, Electric Circuits, Analog Electronics, Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis, Finite Element Analysis, Signals and Systems, Digital Signal Processing, Probability and Statistics, Analog Electronics, and Digital Electronics.
