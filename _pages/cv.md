Work experience
======
* September 2024 - Present: Graduate Researcher
  * Shastri’s Neuromorphic Photonics Lab
  * Graduate Research Assistantship as part of my Master’s degree at Queen’s University. Research mainly focused on Silicon Photonics.
  * Supervisor: Bhavin J. Shastri

* September 2024 - Present: Teaching Assistant
  * Queen's University
  * TAing APSC 111 (Mechanics) and APSC 102 (Physics Lab) courses in Fall 2024; APSC 112 (Electricity and
    Magnetism) and PHYS 116 (Physics for Life Science Students) in Winter 2025.

* September 2024 - Present: Tutor
  * Independent
  * Tutored wide range of courses from High School Math+Physics courses to advanced Electrical Engineering courses. I tutored both independently and through VarsityTutors.

* September 2023 - September 2024: Research Intern
  * Lab for Laser and Optical Communication at Ain Shams University
  * Research internship in Silicon Photonics. Project: Spot-Size Converter for PICs.
  * Supervisor: Hussein Kotb

* March 2023 - March 2024: Junior Research Assistant
  *  NISC (Nano Integrated Systems Center)
  *  Researching in the following topics: Control Theory, Analog Fractional-Order Circuits, and chaotic systems. The research focuses analog implementations (On FPAAs) of the circuits and systems previously mentioned.

* July 2022 - March 2023: Intern R&D Engineer
  * Innovation and Design Technology
  * I was part of a Research and Development team that focused on reverse engineering and designing industrial products. We, as a team, took products from just an idea to analysis, to designing+manufacturing the hardware, to developing the embedded software of the product. I received an enormous experience in project planning, teamwork, analysis, creating products from scratch, and reverse engineering. I grew a lot of technical experience in embedded hardware engineering.

Trainings
======
* July 2023 - August 2023: RF/mm-wave IC Design Summer Intern
  * Analog Devices
  * Analog Devices RF Summer Internship: The internship covered RF and Microwave Basics, Layout Design, Analog IC Design, Low-Noise Amplifiers, Mixers,
 Power-Amplifiers, PLLs. The softwares covered in the training were Cadence Virtuoso, ADS, and Sonnet EM.

* January 2023 - February 2023: Microstrip Antenna Design on CST Training
  * Electronics Research Institute
  * ERI Winter Training program: The training held at the Electronics Research Institute covered baiscs of Antenna theory and focused on design and optimization of Microstrip Antennas. The training involved practical excercises on CST software and the final project was designing a microstrip antenna for WLAN.

* August 2023- September 2023: Analog IC Design
  * ITI
  * ITI Summer Training Program: The Analog IC Design course instructed by Dr. Hesham Omran at ITI. The course covered basic and advanced topics in Analog IC Design. The topic covered included (but not limited to): MOSFET sizing chart using gm/ID design methodology, amplifier topologies, differential amplifiers, OTA design, amplifier frequency response, current mirrors, feedbacks. Cadence Virtuoso was used for the labs.
