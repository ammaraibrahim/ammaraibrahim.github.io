## Varsity Tutors

I worked with VarsityTutors as well and tutored a wide range of courses. Here are several feedbacks I recieved during my time at VarsityTutors.

### Signals and Systems
![Ammar is so amazing because in any class I need help with from linear algebra all the way to statistics of signal processing, he is able to explain confusing concepts in such a simple way. He is perfect for upperclassmen (or anyone) majoring in Electrical Engineering!](/images/Varsity/4-Dec-2024.jpg)

![Ammar is an amazing tutor and clearly shows mastery over the topics he tutors. He is able to explain confusing topics in an understandable way without making me feel unintelligent.](/images/Varsity/18-Nov-2024.jpg)

### Differential Equations
![Awesome session. Learned a lot in only 1.5h! He is very knowledgable in this topic (Laplace Transforms): He helped me break down the complex concept into easy steps and his enthusiasm allowed me to remember them by heart :)](/images/Varsity/4-Dec-2024-sec.jpg)

![He was able to explain complex concepts very well and helped me visualize mathematical problems in real-life applications instead of just memorizing them. You can tell he understands the concepts inside and out, ensures you have a solid understanding before moving on, and is patient with his learners :) Excellent tutor.](/images/Varsity/31-Oct-2024.jpg)

### Calculus 3

![This was the best tutoring session I have ever had. I have a test in two days so we did a comprehensive review of all the material that will be covered on my test. Ammar put a tremendous amount of effort into composing slides for each topic and explained each topic with ease showing an intuitive and deep understanding of each concept in a way in which my professor could not. I would highly recommend Ammar to anyone who is struggling to understand complex concepts intuitively as I am confident he will be able to anyone to understand willing to put in the effort.](/images/Varsity/29-Oct-2024.jpg)
